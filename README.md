# Image-Captioning

This project implements and compares two deep learning approaches for automatic image captioning: CNN-LSTM and CNN-Transformer models. Both models use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract visual features from images, and then generate descriptive captions using either an LSTM-based or Transformer-based decoder.

Youâ€™ll find all the source files, code, and notebooks above.
Feel free to explore, run the models, and compare their performance!
